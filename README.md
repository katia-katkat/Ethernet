# Project description 
Ethernet communication protocol using the ethernet lite MAC and the Microblaze microprocessor to run the IP stack. 

To replicate the project, clone the repository and execute the following commands :

#### Run on TCL console : 
````
cd [project location]
source Ethernet_script.tcl
````
The TCL script contains a series of commands that automate the process of creating and configuring the project, adding sources, setting up constraints, generating IP cores, and building the design. 

⚠️This project is compatible with Vivado versions prior to 2019.2, as the mii2rmii IP core has been deprecated in more recent versions of Vivado.
